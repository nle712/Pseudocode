1. What are some pros and cons of using linked lists instead of arrays?

Pros of using a linked list instead of arrays are that the are independently stored. Since they are independently stored adding or deleting does not require a shift. The nodes can also be large in size.

Cons of using a linked list it is inefficient because it needs to access every element starting with the first one in the list till it finds the one it wants. It also consumes more space because it is all over.

2. Come up with a real world example of a linked list.

A real world example of a linked list is a scavenger hunt. You need one clue to get to the next clue and to get to the last clue you need to go through all of the other clues from the beginning.

Programming Questions
You may program the following questions in any language of your choice (JavaScript, Ruby, etc.).

Before beginning to code, write out a plan explaining how to solve the question.

The linked list push function should take a value, create a node, and add it to the end of a list. Below is pseudocode for a push function for a singly linked list. However, there is something wrong with it. Submit both an explanation of the bug and a functional implementation of the method.

FUNCTION push(element)
CREATE node
SET node.value TO element
SET node.next TO null

IF the head node does not exist
 THEN SET head to node
ELSE
 SET current to head
 SET current.next to node
END IF
END FUNCTION
Given an unsorted singly linked list, remove all duplicates from the linked list.
Example
Input: a -> c -> d -> d -> a
Output: a -> c -> d

Given an unsorted singly linked list, reverse it.
Example
Input: a -> b -> c -> d
Output: d -> c -> b -> a
