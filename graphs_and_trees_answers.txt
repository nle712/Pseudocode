What is a binary tree and what makes it unique to other trees?

A binary tree has a right and left side. Each node can only have two children at most. Which is the left child and the right child.

2.	What is a heuristic?

A: Heuristic is a way to guess it will go and find the shortest path. This speeds up the process in order to find the quickest immediate goal for a satisfactory solution.

3.	What is another problem besides the shortest-path problem that requires the use of heuristics?

A: Travelling salesman problem. This is when a salesman is going to numerous cities and wants to find the shortest route to go to each city.

4.	What is the difference between a depth-first search and a breadth-first search?

A: A depth-first search is traveling down one branch to find the desired element. Continue up the branch and if it is still not found repeat this again on another branch. Breadth-first search is when we are searching the entire row of nodes before going to the next row of nodes. We start on the left most branch and go to the right most branch before going down to the next row.

5.	Explain in your own words what an undirected, a-cyclic, unweighted graph is.

A:  An Undirected, a-cyclic, unweighted graph is when two nodes do not have a set direction, it does not form and loops and will eventually have an end. It also does not have a cost of travel between the nodes.

6.	What kind of graph is a binary search tree?

A: A Binary search tree is a Directed, A-cyclic, unweighted tree.
