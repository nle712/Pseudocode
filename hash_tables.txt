What is a hash table?

A: A hash table is a data structure that has a value that is linked by a key.
They make a key-value pair, which is like a JavaScript object. The keys are all unique; since they are unique, the values can be found by looking up the key. Hash tables store all of this information.

What is hashing?

A: Hashing  is the process of converting data into a hash code using a hashing function.

How does a hash table store data?

A:A hash table store data by converting the key into a hash code and storing it in an array index.

How are hash tables and objects different?

A:Hash tables are used as a collection of similar data, while objects can hold different types of data put together.

Determine whether you would use a hash table or an object to store each of the following pieces of data:
A list of pets and their unique names.- Hash table
The name, age, and the birthday of your best friend. - Object
The name and location of every company in a given city. - Object
All of the books checked out from a library by a particular individual. - Hash table
The primary and secondary phone numbers for a contact. - Hash table

Build a system that allows a sales associate to enter a customer's name, address, and phone number into the system and look up customers using their phone numbers. Store this information in a hash table.
